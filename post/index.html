<p><strong>Bootleg Biology Saison Parfait vs East Coast Yeast Saison Brasserie (ECY08)</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning to brew a few traditional saisons this year, with the hope to home in on something tasty to submit to a competition this fall.</p>
<p>Today, I&rsquo;ll be trying a couple of new-to-me saison yeasts to see which I like better. Last year I brewed a <a href="/saisonsteins-hoppy-saison">similar batch</a> with Omega Saisonstein&rsquo;s Monster. I&rsquo;ll try to make some comparisons to that from memory as well.</p>
<p>For yeast choice, I took some inspiration from Drew Beechum&rsquo;s great <a href="https://www.maltosefalcons.com/tech/guide-saisons-and-saison-yeasts">Guide to Saisons and Saison Yeasts</a>. He says ECY08 is his favorite for a classic saison. Bootleg&rsquo;s Saison Parfait seems less talked about, but I like Bootleg so I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try.</p>

			<p><img src="/img/pale-sour/aging.jpg" alt="aging beer"></p>
<p>Last year was my first serious year of brewing funky and sour beers. A lot of what I brewed was aiming for bold fruit flavors. I added fruit to my <a href="/cherry-wine">cherry wine</a> and <a href="/pale-apricot-sour">apricot sour</a> very early in their fermentations, aiming for a depth of fruit flavors in the final products. The <a href="/dark-saison-i">dark saison</a> got zante currants as soon as it went into secondary.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll still brew that way occasionally in the future, but in general I&rsquo;m going to start waiting for the base beer to mature, and then decide what further additions to make, if any.</p>
<p>In this case I&rsquo;m going for a pale sour similar to my apricot sour, but I&rsquo;ll hold off on any fruit additions at first. I&rsquo;m hoping the base beer will turn out complex, sour, and funky. When it&rsquo;s ready, I&rsquo;ll let its final character dictate where to go from there.</p>
<p>Some fruit options I&rsquo;m considering are peaches, sour cherries, blueberries, or wine grapes. I&rsquo;ll also bottle some of it straight if it&rsquo;s interesting on it&rsquo;s own.</p>

<p>Low-ish alcohol and big-ish flavor are the order of the day. I&rsquo;m aiming for a sessionable ~5.3% hazy pale ale with lots of hop character.</p>
<p>The hop blend will be an old favorite of mine: amarillo, citra, and simcoe. But for something a little different, I&rsquo;m going to use all cryo hops.</p>

<p>The solera project is about to turn one year old. Before I can package the first year&rsquo;s beer, I need get year two&rsquo;s refill ready to go in.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be brewing two batches to get enough volume for this year. I expect to need about six gallons to refill the barrel and the rest will age in a keg that I&rsquo;ll use to keep the barrel topped up. I think I&rsquo;ll get enough extra in the keg for about two years of top ups.</p>
<p>Last year, top ups were the most error prone and annoying part of the barrel aging process. Each time I topped up the barrel, I had to rack the top up beer into smaller and smaller vessels to avoid leaving excessive headspace. In the end I wasted a lot of the top up beer, and the top up beer that remained at the end of the year didn&rsquo;t taste great.</p>
<p>Storing the top up beer in a keg and topping up the barrel with a picnic tap should be a much nicer way to keep the barrel full. I&rsquo;ll never have to rack the top up beer around again, and it&rsquo;ll always be protected from oxygen.</p>

<p>Happy almost winter! This batch will be an oatmeal stout to test out HBC 472 as a dark beer flavor hop.</p>
<p>472 is a newer hop with some pretty unusual taste descriptors: wood, coconut, vanilla.</p>
<p>I got to try an IPA that was dry hopped with this a little while ago. It was definitely different. I didn&rsquo;t really get the wood/vanilla but there were some coconut notes. It was a bit odd in IPA form but I thought it might make a good dark beer.</p>

			<p>Today&rsquo;s brew is going to be a pale beer/wine hybrid.</p>
<p>In the past, my approach for combining wine and beer has been to blend finished commercial wine into my beers at a rate between one cup, and a whole bottle in five gallons of beer. Results have been good, but a bit on the subtle side. Today I want to try to make something more wine forward &ndash; a real beer/wine hybrid instead of just a beer with a little bit of wine in it.</p>
<p>Whole grapes would be great for this, but that&rsquo;s a large and expensive purchase. I&rsquo;m going to need some planning and confidence when I do finally buy a 5 gallon pail of frozen grapes.</p>
<p>Instead of whole grapes, for this batch I&rsquo;m going to add the undiluted contents of a one gallon (~5 bottles) wine kit a few days into primary.</p>

			<p>I love dry, rustic, funky ciders. This style is a small but growing segment of the commercial market, still quite hard for me to find reliably, and expensive when I do find it. Home brewing to the rescue! If the market isn&rsquo;t producing what you want, produce it yourself.</p>
<p>Last year, I did a two hasty experiments into non-traditional cider fermentation. One of them is in the top three ciders I&rsquo;ve ever tasted! The other is a drain pour. So it goes when you experiment sometimes.</p>
<p>In 2020 I&rsquo;m going all in on funky cider with 4 different single-strain 100% Brett batches. That post is coming soon. For today, I wanted to share some my experiences from last year: some lessons learned, what worked and what didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Eight years ago, Adrienne and I planted hop rhizomes in the corner of her parents garden: cascade, and nugget I think. Since then they&rsquo;ve been neglected, growing kind of wild. We never trellised or harvested them. I thought they might not survive like this, but they seem to be hardy plants!</p>
<p>This year, a deer fence went up around the garden. The hops climbed all over it and produced an unexpected bounty. With so many hops just sitting there, I decided I&rsquo;d finally try making a beer with them.</p>

<p>Some beers can transport you to another time and place. English Bitter does that for me. I really came to appreciate the style a few years ago on a trip around England. The trip was a ton of fun, and I got to enjoy a variety of English ales in their traditional cask presentations.</p>
<p>Of the styles I tried, Bitter was my favorite. Like many of the traditional English ales, it is flavorful, low in alcohol, and a refreshing change of pace for a palate that&rsquo;s suffering a bit of IPA fatigue.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s a sign that I&rsquo;m getting old, but in the last few years I&rsquo;ve gained much more appreciation for subtle beer &ndash; &ldquo;beer flavored beer&rdquo;. Bitter is high in the running to be my overall favorite beer flavored beer</p>

<p>Many of my brewing ideas come from trying a great commercial beer and wanting to replicate its flavors at home. Today&rsquo;s subject is Sapwood&rsquo;s <a href="https://untappd.com/b/sapwood-cellars-brewery-the-dragon/3566895">The Dragon</a> which used a hop blend that I had never tried before: Mosaic, Nelson Sauvin, and Hallertau Blanc.</p>
<p>Both Nelson Sauvin and Hallertau Blanc are typically described as having wine-like qualities. Nelson Sauvin in particular has a reputation for being very unique, and a bit polarizing. I thought The Dragon was delicious though, so I guess I might be a fan.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t be a clone, just a recipe inspired by the hop blend from the original.</p>
