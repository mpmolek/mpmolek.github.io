&lt;p&gt;Happy almost winter! This batch will be an oatmeal stout to test out HBC 472 as a dark beer flavor hop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;472 is a newer hop with some pretty unusual taste descriptors: wood, coconut, vanilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to try an IPA that was dry hopped with this a little while ago. It was definitely different. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get the wood/vanilla but there were some coconut notes. It was a bit odd in IPA form but I thought it might make a good dark beer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rye Barrel Stout</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/rye-stout/boil.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;We&amp;rsquo;re going to need a bigger fermenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beer is the first brew to go into my 15 gallon Dad&amp;rsquo;s Hat rye whiskey barrel. That barrel is destined for sour solera duty, but first I want to brew a couple of big clean beers to make the most of the barrel&amp;rsquo;s fresh whiskey character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stout is based on a KBS clone recipe from Zymurgy that I first brewed way back in 2013. That was a great beer, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to try making it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
