      <description>&lt;p&gt;Double sour brew day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still very new to sour beer brewing. Rather than going off and experimenting right away, I want to start with some proven recipes. Today I&amp;rsquo;m starting a couple of beers inspired by my favorite sours to come out of Sapwood Cellars to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, &lt;a href=&#34;https://untappd.com/b/sapwood-cellars-brewery-opulence/3497213&#34;&gt;Opulence&lt;/a&gt;, a sour red that has two separate cherry additions.  Aged in a mix of red wine and bourbon barrels, dry sour cherries were added early in the aging process, and then before bottling it was finished on fresh sour cherries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before trying it I was a little skeptical of combination of bourbon bourbon aging a sour beer, but the vanilla character of the barrels worked really nicely with the cherries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rye Barrel Old Ale</title>

&lt;p&gt;The second beer to go into my 15 gallon Dad&amp;rsquo;s Hat rye whiskey barrel will be an old ale brewed with black treacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old ale is a wide ranging style. For this version we&amp;rsquo;re shooting for ~7% abv (before barrel aging), complexity from black treacle, and not too much residual sugar. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this all plays nicely with the gentle contribution from a barrel that&amp;rsquo;s already held imperial stout for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for the recipe comes from a Beer and Brewing &lt;a href=&#34;https://beerandbrewing.com/make-your-best-old-ale/&#34;&gt;article on old ale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rye Barrel Stout</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/rye-stout/boil.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;We&amp;rsquo;re going to need a bigger fermenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beer is the first brew to go into my 15 gallon Dad&amp;rsquo;s Hat rye whiskey barrel. That barrel is destined for sour solera duty, but first I want to brew a couple of big clean beers to make the most of the barrel&amp;rsquo;s fresh whiskey character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stout is based on a KBS clone recipe from Zymurgy that I first brewed way back in 2013. That was a great beer, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to try making it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
