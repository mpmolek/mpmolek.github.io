&lt;p&gt;This is batch number two of my IPA experiment series. In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/galaxy-citra-neipa-experiment&#34;&gt;first batch&lt;/a&gt; I tested out some new equipment and techniques. The beers were some of the best IPAs I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made, but they were very hard to tell apart. It felt like I had one beer taking up two taps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a bad sign for my motivation for testing small tweaks, but for this round I feel like having a litte fun and brewing two significantly different IPAs just to compare the hop blends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have ideas of what hops I like, but it&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to have two equally fresh beers to taste at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One of my brewing goals for 2020 is to improve the quality of my IPAs. I feel like this far into the brewing game, I should have a little more to show for it when I make my favorite style. They&amp;rsquo;re rarely bad, but they don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt; as often as I&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end I&amp;rsquo;m going to be doing a series of experiments this year where make two similar beers at the same time, with just one variable changed. I hope this will improve my process, one tweak at at time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this brew, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out some new hardware and techniques that I&amp;rsquo;ll use for the rest of my upcoming experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
