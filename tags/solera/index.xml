      <title>Solera Series: Year Two Recipe &#43; Notes</title>

&lt;p&gt;The solera project is about to turn one year old. Before I can package the first year&amp;rsquo;s beer, I need get year two&amp;rsquo;s refill ready to go in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be brewing two batches to get enough volume for this year. I expect to need about six gallons to refill the barrel and the rest will age in a keg that I&amp;rsquo;ll use to keep the barrel topped up. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll get enough extra in the keg for about two years of top ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, top ups were the most error prone and annoying part of the barrel aging process. Each time I topped up the barrel, I had to rack the top up beer into smaller and smaller vessels to avoid leaving excessive headspace. In the end I wasted a lot of the top up beer, and the top up beer that remained at the end of the year didn&amp;rsquo;t taste great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing the top up beer in a keg and topping up the barrel with a picnic tap should be a much nicer way to keep the barrel full. I&amp;rsquo;ll never have to rack the top up beer around again, and it&amp;rsquo;ll always be protected from oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the recipe for my Flanders Red solera project as brewed in late 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a slightly Americanized take on the style, based on the &amp;ldquo;Wine Barrel Flemish Red&amp;rdquo; from American Sour Beers. I may change it a bit over the years as I see how the beer develops. I&amp;rsquo;ll link to any new posts related to this recipe in the notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solera Series: Planning &amp; First Fill</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/rye-stout/barrel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fresh barrel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to start my own sour solera project ever since I started making sour beer. Barrels aren&amp;rsquo;t a requirement for a solera, lots of people make them in carboys or other vessels. But I have a romantic image of barrel aged beers and wanted to try the process for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this project I&amp;rsquo;d never brewed with a barrel or even seriously considered getting one. I did a lot of background reading and I want to share what I learned getting ready for my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choose-a-barrel-size&#34;&gt;Choose a barrel size&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used barrels come in a wide variety of sizes. A standard American whiskey barrel is 53 gallons. Wine barrels are typically a little larger. 60 gallons is a common size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller barrels in the 5 to 30 gallon range are also available on the used market. Most come from small whiskey producers. I&amp;rsquo;m not aware of any sources for small wine barrels or if any wineries even use small barrels. It seems that if you want a small used barrel, you&amp;rsquo;re getting a whiskey barrel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
