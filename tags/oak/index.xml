      <title>Pale Lambic-ish Sour</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/pale-sour/aging.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;aging beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year was my first serious year of brewing funky and sour beers. A lot of what I brewed was aiming for bold fruit flavors. I added fruit to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/cherry-wine&#34;&gt;cherry wine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/pale-apricot-sour&#34;&gt;apricot sour&lt;/a&gt; very early in their fermentations, aiming for a depth of fresh and aged fruit flavors in the final product. My &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/dark-saison-i&#34;&gt;dark saison&lt;/a&gt; got zante currants as soon as it went into secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll still brew that way occasionally in the future, but in general I&amp;rsquo;m going to start waiting for the base beer to mature, and then decide what further additions would benefit it, if any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case I&amp;rsquo;m going for a pale sour similar to my apricot sour, but I&amp;rsquo;ll hold off on any fruit additions at first. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the base beer will turn out complex, sour, and funky. When it&amp;rsquo;s ready, I&amp;rsquo;ll let its final character dictate where to go from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fruit options I&amp;rsquo;m considering are peaches, sour cherries, blueberries, or red wine grapes. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably bottle some of it straight if it&amp;rsquo;s interesting on it&amp;rsquo;s own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solera Series: Year Two Recipe &#43; Notes</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/solera-series-year-two-recipe-notes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/solera/barrel-year-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;solera barrel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solera project is about to turn one year old. Before I can package the first year&amp;rsquo;s beer, I need get year two&amp;rsquo;s refill ready to go in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be brewing two batches to get enough volume for this year. I expect to need about six gallons to refill the barrel and the rest will age in a keg that I&amp;rsquo;ll use to keep the barrel topped up. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll get enough extra in the keg for about two years of top ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, top ups were the most error prone and annoying part of the barrel aging process. Each time I topped up the barrel, I had to rack the top up beer into smaller and smaller vessels to avoid leaving excessive headspace. In the end I wasted a lot of the top up beer, and the top up beer that remained at the end of the year didn&amp;rsquo;t taste great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing the top up beer in a keg and topping up the barrel with a picnic tap should be a much nicer way to keep the barrel full. I&amp;rsquo;ll never have to rack the top up beer around again, and it&amp;rsquo;ll always be protected from oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>White Wine Farmhouse Ale</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/white-wine-farmhouse-ale/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s brew is going to be a pale beer/wine hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, my approach for combining wine and beer has been to blend finished commercial wine into my beers at a rate between one cup, and a whole bottle in five gallons of beer. Results have been good, but a bit on the subtle side. Today I want to try to make something more wine forward &amp;ndash; a real beer/wine hybrid instead of just a beer with a little bit of wine in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole grapes would be great for this, but that&amp;rsquo;s a large and expensive purchase. I&amp;rsquo;m going to need some planning and confidence when I do finally buy a 5 gallon pail of frozen grapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of whole grapes, for this batch I&amp;rsquo;m going to add the undiluted contents of a one gallon (~5 bottles) wine kit a few days into primary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rustic Saison</title>

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite styles these days is mixed fermentation tart saison. Earlier in the year I made my &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/saison-vinifera&#34;&gt;first attempt&lt;/a&gt; at brewing one myself. For that beer, I blended about 20% kettle soured berliner weisse to a saison that had brett, but no souring bacteria added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t finished yet, but from some gravity samples I think it&amp;rsquo;s going to end up being tasty, but not as tart as I expected from my blending tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my second go at the style, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use a full range of brett and souring bacteria. To hopefully get a light tartness instead of full-on souring, I&amp;rsquo;m going to mash low and wait until a few days into fermetation before adding the sour bugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dark Saison I</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/dark-saison-i/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This batch continues the deep dive I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking into mixed fermentation brewing over the last 6 months. I have a bunch of sours in the pipeline now and I&amp;rsquo;d like to get some funky, non-sour, brett beers going. I brewed my first &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/saison-vinifera&#34;&gt;brett saison&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago. This will be my second attempt in the broad style of funky saison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2019/04/dark-funky-saison-retrospective.html&#34;&gt;10 year retrospective&lt;/a&gt; from The Mad Fermentationist&amp;rsquo;s yearly dark saison project was inspirational. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to keep up my own similar series. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll probably take inspiration from Mike and friends the first couple years, and then strike out with my own experimental brews as I get more comfortable with this style of funky brewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the standout beers from that tasting was year four&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2012/01/american-farmhouse-currant-dark-saison.html&#34;&gt;American Farmhouse Currant Dark Saison&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to brew that recipe for the first shot at this style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Saison Vinifera</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/saison-vinifera/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitis_vinifera&#34;&gt;Vitus Vinifera&lt;/a&gt; is the scientific name for the species that contains most varieties of wine grapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;Saison Vinifera&amp;rdquo; will blend funky tart saison, oak, and wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/sapwood-saisons-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bottles of No Beginnings and First Blush&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large portion of my homebrewing over the last six months has been focused on trying to emulate the great mixed fermentation beers coming out of my favorite local brewery, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sapwoodcellars.com&#34;&gt;Sapwood Cellars&lt;/a&gt;. Two of those beers were delicious tart saisons that they released in fall 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Beginnings&lt;/strong&gt; was a pale saison with Brettanomyces, aged in Sauvignon Blanc wine barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to bet that &lt;strong&gt;First Blush&lt;/strong&gt; started life as a similar base beer to No Beginnings, but it was fermented with chardonnay &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomace&#34;&gt;pomace&lt;/a&gt;, and finished on whole Cabernet Franc grapes. It is ros√© in appearance and the flavor has a unique light, tart fruitiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan is to brew a batch of funky pale saison, split it half in secondary, and see how close to each of these I can get&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sour time again! This type of beer has a long turnaround time, so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get a lage pipeline going this winter. Hopefully next year I can start having somewhat regular releases of finished sours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This batch is inspired by Sapwood Cellars &lt;a href=&#34;https://untappd.com/b/sapwood-cellars-brewery-upper-bound-apricot/3636986&#34;&gt;Upper Bound: Apricot&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first first apricot sour I ever tried, and I thought it was fantastic. One of my favorite releases from them so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the recipe for my Flanders Red solera project as brewed in late 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a slightly Americanized take on the style, based on the &amp;ldquo;Wine Barrel Flemish Red&amp;rdquo; from American Sour Beers. I may change it a bit over the years as I see how the beer develops. I&amp;rsquo;ll link to any new posts related to this recipe in the notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solera Series: Planning &amp; First Fill</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/solera-series-planning-first-fill/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/rye-stout/barrel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fresh barrel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to start my own sour solera project ever since I started making sour beer. Barrels aren&amp;rsquo;t a requirement for a solera, lots of people make them in carboys or other vessels. But I have a romantic image of barrel aged beers and wanted to try the process for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this project I&amp;rsquo;d never brewed with a barrel or even seriously considered getting one. I did a lot of background reading and I want to share what I learned getting ready for my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choose-a-barrel-size&#34;&gt;Choose a barrel size&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used barrels come in a wide variety of sizes. A standard American whiskey barrel is 53 gallons. Wine barrels are typically a little larger. 60 gallons is a common size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller barrels in the 5 to 30 gallon range are also available on the used market. Most come from small whiskey producers. I&amp;rsquo;m not aware of any sources for small wine barrels or if any wineries even use small barrels. It seems that if you want a small used barrel, you&amp;rsquo;re getting a whiskey barrel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Double sour brew day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still very new to sour beer brewing. Rather than going off and experimenting right away, I want to start with some proven recipes. Today I&amp;rsquo;m starting a couple of beers inspired by my favorite sours to come out of Sapwood Cellars to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, &lt;a href=&#34;https://untappd.com/b/sapwood-cellars-brewery-opulence/3497213&#34;&gt;Opulence&lt;/a&gt;, a sour red that has two separate cherry additions.  Aged in a mix of red wine and bourbon barrels, dry sour cherries were added early in the aging process, and then before bottling it was finished on fresh sour cherries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before trying it I was a little skeptical of combination of bourbon bourbon aging a sour beer, but the vanilla character of the barrels worked really nicely with the cherries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rye Barrel Old Ale</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/rye-barrel-old-ale/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The second beer to go into my 15 gallon Dad&amp;rsquo;s Hat rye whiskey barrel will be an old ale brewed with black treacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old ale is a wide ranging style. For this version we&amp;rsquo;re shooting for ~7% abv (before barrel aging), complexity from black treacle, and not too much residual sugar. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this all plays nicely with the gentle contribution from a barrel that&amp;rsquo;s already held imperial stout for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for the recipe comes from a Beer and Brewing &lt;a href=&#34;https://beerandbrewing.com/make-your-best-old-ale/&#34;&gt;article on old ale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rye Barrel Stout</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/rye-stout/boil.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;We&amp;rsquo;re going to need a bigger fermenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beer is the first brew to go into my 15 gallon Dad&amp;rsquo;s Hat rye whiskey barrel. That barrel is destined for sour solera duty, but first I want to brew a couple of big clean beers to make the most of the barrel&amp;rsquo;s fresh whiskey character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stout is based on a KBS clone recipe from Zymurgy that I first brewed way back in 2013. That was a great beer, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to try making it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
