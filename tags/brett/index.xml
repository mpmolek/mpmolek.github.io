      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love dry, rustic, funky ciders. This style is a small but growing segment of the commercial market, still quite hard for me to find reliably, and expensive when I do find it. Home brewing to the rescue! If the market isn&amp;rsquo;t producing what you want, produce it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I did a two hasty experiments into non-traditional cider fermentation. One of them is in the top three ciders I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tasted! The other is a drain pour. So it goes when you experiment sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020 I&amp;rsquo;m going all in on funky cider with 4 different single-strain 100% Brett batches. That post is coming soon. For today, I wanted to share some my experiences from last year: some lessons learned, what worked and what didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
