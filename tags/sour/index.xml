      <title>Pale Lambic-ish Sour</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/pale-sour/aging.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;aging beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year was my first serious year of brewing funky and sour beers. A lot of what I brewed was aiming for bold fruit flavors. I added fruit to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/cherry-wine&#34;&gt;cherry wine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/pale-apricot-sour&#34;&gt;apricot sour&lt;/a&gt; very early in their fermentations, aiming for a depth of fresh and aged fruit flavors in the final product. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/dark-saison-i&#34;&gt;dark saison&lt;/a&gt; got zante currants as soon as it went into secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll still brew that way occasionally in the future, but in general I&amp;rsquo;m going to start waiting for the base beer to mature, and then decide what further additions would benefit it, if any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case I&amp;rsquo;m going for a pale sour similar to my apricot sour, but I&amp;rsquo;ll hold off on any fruit additions at first. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the base beer will turn out complex, sour, and funky. When it&amp;rsquo;s ready, I&amp;rsquo;ll let its final character dictate where to go from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fruit options I&amp;rsquo;m considering are peaches, sour cherries, blueberries, or red wine grapes. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably bottle some of it straight if it&amp;rsquo;s interesting on it&amp;rsquo;s own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solera Series: Year Two Recipe &#43; Notes</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/solera-series-year-two-recipe-notes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/solera/barrel-year-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;solera barrel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solera project is about to turn one year old. Before I can package the first year&amp;rsquo;s beer, I need get year two&amp;rsquo;s refill ready to go in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be brewing two batches to get enough volume for this year. I expect to need about six gallons to refill the barrel and the rest will age in a keg that I&amp;rsquo;ll use to keep the barrel topped up. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll get enough extra in the keg for about two years of top ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, top ups were the most error prone and annoying part of the barrel aging process. Each time I topped up the barrel, I had to rack the top up beer into smaller and smaller vessels to avoid leaving excessive headspace. In the end I wasted a lot of the top up beer, and the top up beer that remained at the end of the year didn&amp;rsquo;t taste great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing the top up beer in a keg and topping up the barrel with a picnic tap should be a much nicer way to keep the barrel full. I&amp;rsquo;ll never have to rack the top up beer around again, and it&amp;rsquo;ll always be protected from oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spring 2020 Sour Check-in</title>

&lt;p&gt;The last six months have been busy with weird beer brewing. I&amp;rsquo;m now six batches into brewing sours with no finished products yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I topped up and sampled a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pale Apricot Sour</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sour time again! This type of beer has a long turnaround time, so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get a lage pipeline going this winter. Hopefully next year I can start having somewhat regular releases of finished sours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This batch is inspired by Sapwood Cellars &lt;a href=&#34;https://untappd.com/b/sapwood-cellars-brewery-upper-bound-apricot/3636986&#34;&gt;Upper Bound: Apricot&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first first apricot sour I ever tried, and I thought it was fantastic. One of my favorite releases from them so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solera Series: Year One Recipe &#43; Notes</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/solera-series-year-one-recipe-notes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the recipe for my Flanders Red solera project as brewed in late 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a slightly Americanized take on the style, based on the &amp;ldquo;Wine Barrel Flemish Red&amp;rdquo; from American Sour Beers. I may change it a bit over the years as I see how the beer develops. I&amp;rsquo;ll link to any new posts related to this recipe in the notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solera Series: Planning &amp; First Fill</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/solera-series-planning-first-fill/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/rye-stout/barrel.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fresh barrel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been itching to start my own sour solera project ever since I started making sour beer. Barrels aren&amp;rsquo;t a requirement for a solera, lots of people make them in carboys or other vessels. But I have a romantic image of barrel aged beers and wanted to try the process for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to this project I&amp;rsquo;d never brewed with a barrel or even seriously considered getting one. I did a lot of background reading and I want to share what I learned getting ready for my project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choose-a-barrel-size&#34;&gt;Choose a barrel size&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Used barrels come in a wide variety of sizes. A standard American whiskey barrel is 53 gallons. Wine barrels are typically a little larger. 60 gallons is a common size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller barrels in the 5 to 30 gallon range are also available on the used market. Most come from small whiskey producers. I&amp;rsquo;m not aware of any sources for small wine barrels or if any wineries even use small barrels. It seems that if you want a small used barrel, you&amp;rsquo;re getting a whiskey barrel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cherry Wine</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Double sour brew day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still very new to sour beer brewing. Rather than going off and experimenting right away, I want to start with some proven recipes. Today I&amp;rsquo;m starting a couple of beers inspired by my favorite sours to come out of Sapwood Cellars to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, &lt;a href=&#34;https://untappd.com/b/sapwood-cellars-brewery-opulence/3497213&#34;&gt;Opulence&lt;/a&gt;, a sour red that has two separate cherry additions.  Aged in a mix of red wine and bourbon barrels, dry sour cherries were added early in the aging process, and then before bottling it was finished on fresh sour cherries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before trying it I was a little skeptical of combination of bourbon bourbon aging a sour beer, but the vanilla character of the barrels worked really nicely with the cherries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Extract Kettle Sour Berliner Weisse</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/extract-kettle-sour-berliner-weisse/</link>

      <guid>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/extract-kettle-sour-berliner-weisse/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/starter-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lacto starter&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/souring-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Souring&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked Berliner Weisse, but never brewed one. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to experiment with kettle souring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure I&amp;rsquo;m following comes from this great presentation by Derek Springer: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fivebladesbrewing.com/presentations/berliner-and-beyond-sour-mashing-and-its-applications/&#34;&gt;Berliner and Beyond: Sour Mashing and Its Applications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a starter for your lacto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your wort under 4.5 pH as soon as possible to deter unwanted microbes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold at a happy temperature for your lacto strain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize oxygen exposure by covering with plastic wrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, boil, chill, and pitch yeast as normal to finish the beer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
