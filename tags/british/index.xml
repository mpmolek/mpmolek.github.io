      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy summer without much brewing, but I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to get back to my regularly scheduled beer making this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start, Adrienne has requested a Best Bitter, after humoring my lineup of sour and saison experiments the last 6 months. No complaints from me though, English Bitter is one of my favorite beer styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brewed a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/best-bitter&#34;&gt;Best Bitter last year&lt;/a&gt; that I liked a lot. This time, for some variety, I&amp;rsquo;m going to brew a batch based on the 2021 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.homebrewersassociation.org/national-homebrew-competition/winners/&#34;&gt;NHC&lt;/a&gt; winning recipe from the pale British ale category. Compared to my recipe from last year, this will be a bit darker and maltier, a lot hoppier, and should have more body from a much higher mash temperature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Some beers can transport you to another time and place. English Bitter does that for me. I really came to appreciate the style a few years ago on a trip around England. The trip was a ton of fun, and I got to enjoy a variety of English ales in their traditional cask presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the styles I tried, Bitter was my favorite. Like many of the traditional English ales, it is flavorful, low in alcohol, and a refreshing change of pace for a palate that&amp;rsquo;s suffering a bit of IPA fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a sign that I&amp;rsquo;m getting old, but in the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve gained much more appreciation for subtle beer &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;beer flavored beer&amp;rdquo;. Bitter is high in the running to be my overall favorite beer flavored beer&lt;/p&gt;</description>
