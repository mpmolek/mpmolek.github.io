      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/best-bitter/cotswolds.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;english field&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some beers can transport you to another time and place. English Bitter does that for me. I really came to appreciate the style a few years ago on a trip around England. The trip was a ton of fun, and I got to enjoy a variety of English ales in their traditional cask presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the beers I enjoyed, Bitter was my favorite. Like many of the traditional English styles, it is flavorful, low in alcohol, and a refreshing change of pace for a palate that&amp;rsquo;s suffering a bit of IPA fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a sign that I&amp;rsquo;m getting old, but in the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve gained much more appreciation for subtle beer &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;beer flavored beer&amp;rdquo; some call it. Bitter is high in the running to be my overall favorite beer flavored beer&lt;/p&gt;</description>
