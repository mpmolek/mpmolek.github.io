      <title>Pale Lambic-ish Sour</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/pale-lambic-ish-sour/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/pale-sour/aging.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;aging beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year was my first serious year of brewing funky and sour beers. A lot of what I brewed was aiming for bold fruit flavors. I added fruit to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/cherry-wine&#34;&gt;cherry wine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/pale-apricot-sour&#34;&gt;apricot sour&lt;/a&gt; very early in their fermentations, aiming for a depth of fresh and aged fruit flavors in the final product. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/dark-saison-i&#34;&gt;dark saison&lt;/a&gt; got zante currants as soon as it went into secondary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I&amp;rsquo;ll still brew that way occasionally in the future, but in general I&amp;rsquo;m going to start waiting for the base beer to mature, and then decide what further additions to make, if any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case I&amp;rsquo;m going for a pale sour similar to my apricot sour, but I&amp;rsquo;ll hold off on any fruit additions at first. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping the base beer will turn out complex, sour, and funky. When it&amp;rsquo;s ready, I&amp;rsquo;ll let its final character dictate where to go from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some fruit options I&amp;rsquo;m considering are peaches, sour cherries, blueberries, or red wine grapes. I&amp;rsquo;ll also bottle some of it straight if it&amp;rsquo;s interesting on it&amp;rsquo;s own.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hazy Cryo Pale Ale</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/hazy-cryo-pale-ale/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Low-ish alcohol and big-ish flavor are the order of the day. I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for a sessionable ~5.3% hazy pale ale with lots of hop character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hop blend will be an old favorite of mine: amarillo, citra, and simcoe. But for something a little different, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use all cryo hops.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solera Series: Year Two Recipe &#43; Notes</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/solera-series-year-two-recipe-notes/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Dec 2020 20:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/solera-series-year-two-recipe-notes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/solera/barrel-year-2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;solera barrel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solera project is about to turn one year old. Before I can package the first year&amp;rsquo;s beer, I need get year two&amp;rsquo;s refill ready to go in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be brewing two batches to get enough volume for this year. I expect to need about six gallons to refill the barrel and the rest will age in a keg that I&amp;rsquo;ll use to keep the barrel topped up. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll get enough extra in the keg for about two years of top ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, top ups were the most error prone and annoying part of the barrel aging process. Each time I topped up the barrel, I had to rack the top up beer into smaller and smaller vessels to avoid leaving excessive headspace. In the end I wasted a lot of the top up beer, and the top up beer that remained at the end of the year didn&amp;rsquo;t taste great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storing the top up beer in a keg and topping up the barrel with a picnic tap should be a much nicer way to keep the barrel full. I&amp;rsquo;ll never have to rack the top up beer around again, and it&amp;rsquo;ll always be protected from oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HBC 472 Oatmeal Stout</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/hbc-472-oatmeal-stout/</link>

&lt;p&gt;Happy almost winter! This batch will be an oatmeal stout to test out HBC 472 as a dark beer flavor hop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;472 is a newer hop with some pretty unusual taste descriptors: wood, coconut, vanilla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to try an IPA that was dry hopped with this a little while ago. It was definitely different. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really get the wood/vanilla but there were some coconut notes. It was a bit odd in IPA form but I thought it might make a good dark beer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>White Wine Farmhouse Ale</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/white-wine-farmhouse-ale/</link>

      <guid>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/white-wine-farmhouse-ale/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s brew is going to be a pale beer/wine hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, my approach for combining wine and beer has been to blend finished commercial wine into my beers at a rate between one cup, and a whole bottle in five gallons of beer. Results have been good, but a bit on the subtle side. Today I want to try to make something more wine forward &amp;ndash; a real beer/wine hybrid instead of just a beer with a little bit of wine in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole grapes would be great for this, but that&amp;rsquo;s a large and expensive purchase. I&amp;rsquo;m going to need some planning and confidence when I do finally buy a 5 gallon pail of frozen grapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of whole grapes, for this batch I&amp;rsquo;m going to add the undiluted contents of a one gallon (~5 bottles) wine kit a few days into primary.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Two Funky Ciders</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/two-funky-ciders/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/two-funky-ciders/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love dry, rustic, funky ciders. This style is a small but growing segment of the commercial market, still quite hard for me to find reliably, and expensive when I do find it. Home brewing to the rescue! If the market isn&amp;rsquo;t producing what you want, produce it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I did a two hasty experiments into non-traditional cider fermentation. One of them is in the top three ciders I&amp;rsquo;ve ever tasted! The other is a drain pour. So it goes when you experiment sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2020 I&amp;rsquo;m going all in on funky cider with 4 different single-strain 100% Brett batches. That post is coming soon. For today, I wanted to share some my experiences from last year: some lessons learned, what worked and what didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Homegrown Cascade IPA</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/homegrown-cascade-ipa/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/homegrown-ipa/dry-hops.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;dried hops&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight years ago, Adrienne and I planted hop rhizomes in the corner of her parents garden: cascade, and nugget I think. Since then they&amp;rsquo;ve been neglected, growing kind of wild. We never trellised or harvested them. I thought they might not survive like this, but they seem to be hardy plants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, a deer fence went up around the garden. The hops climbed all over it and produced an unexpected bounty. With so many hops just sitting there, I decided I&amp;rsquo;d finally try making a beer with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best Bitter</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/best-bitter/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/best-bitter/cotswolds.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;english field&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some beers can transport you to another time and place. English Bitter does that for me. I really came to appreciate the style a few years ago on a trip around England. The trip was a ton of fun, and I got to enjoy a variety of English ales in their traditional cask presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the styles I tried, Bitter was my favorite. Like many of the traditional English ales, it is flavorful, low in alcohol, and a refreshing change of pace for a palate that&amp;rsquo;s suffering a bit of IPA fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a sign that I&amp;rsquo;m getting old, but in the last few years I&amp;rsquo;ve gained much more appreciation for subtle beer &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;beer flavored beer&amp;rdquo;. Bitter is high in the running to be my overall favorite beer flavored beer&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NEIPA with Mosaic, Nelson, Hallertau Blanc</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/neipa-with-mosaic-nelson-hallertau-blanc/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Jul 2020 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/neipa-with-mosaic-nelson-hallertau-blanc/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/nelson-hallertau.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;finished beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my brewing ideas come from trying a great commercial beer and wanting to replicate its flavors at home. Today&amp;rsquo;s subject is Sapwood&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://untappd.com/b/sapwood-cellars-brewery-the-dragon/3566895&#34;&gt;The Dragon&lt;/a&gt; which used a hop blend that I had never tried before: Mosaic, Nelson Sauvin, and Hallertau Blanc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Nelson Sauvin and Hallertau Blanc are typically described as having wine-like qualities. Nelson Sauvin in particular has a reputation for being very unique, and a bit polarizing. I thought The Dragon was delicious though, so I guess I might be a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This won&amp;rsquo;t be a clone, just a recipe inspired by the hop blend from the original.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Saisonstein&#39;s Hoppy Saison</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/saisonsteins-hoppy-saison/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 26 Jul 2020 16:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/saisonsteins-hoppy-saison/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/saisonstein/portrait2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;finished beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been on a bit of a saison kick lately, starting mixed fermentation batches in &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/saison-vinifera&#34;&gt;April&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/rustic-saison&#34;&gt;May&lt;/a&gt;. Those are still bulk aging with probably a few months left to go before bottling. In the meantime, I feel like experimenting with a quicker 100% Saccharomyces saison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to try out a new (to me) yeast for this brew, Omega &lt;a href=&#34;https://omegayeast.com/yeast/hybrids/saisonsteins-monster&#34;&gt;Saisonstein&amp;rsquo;s Monster&lt;/a&gt; (OLY-500). It&amp;rsquo;s a hybrid strain, bred from Belgain and French saison parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I came across this yeast in Union&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unioncraftbrewing.com/project/rough-draughts-tart-saison/&#34;&gt;Tart Saison&lt;/a&gt;, and liked it enough that I thought it was worth a try at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omega says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[Saisonstein] is versatile, aromatic and attenuative with a silky mouthfeel. It excels in high gravity and it ferments more reliably and thoroughly than its parents. It is spicy, complex, tart, dry and crisp with some bubblegum character present from its Belgian parent, and more fruit and fewer phenolics than its French parent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This test batch won&amp;rsquo;t be as tart as Union&amp;rsquo;s. Theirs was definitely soured somehow, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a firm answer. This beer will use a simple recipe with just the Saisonstein&amp;rsquo;s Monster to let the yeast show what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Citra Session Ale</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/citra-session-ale/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/citra-session/finished.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;finished beer&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some unlucky timing, both &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/experimenting-with-hop-blends&#34;&gt;DIPA variants&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/spring-kolsch&#34;&gt;last kolsch&lt;/a&gt; all kicked within a couple days of each other this week. An empty kegerator is a sad thing. This is going to be a quick &amp;ldquo;what do I have on hand?&amp;rdquo; recipe. Happily, what I have on hand is a buch of citra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having NEIPA and DIPA on my hoppy taps for the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;m in the mood for something easier drinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m aiming for a nice light pale ale in the low 4% abv, moderate bitterness, and solid hop flavor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spring Kolsch 2</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/spring-kolsch-2/</link>

      <description>&lt;figure class=&#34;imagefloatleft&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/kolsch2/small.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More Kolsch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally brew two nearly identical beers so close together, but I was really enjoying the last batch of &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/spring-kolsch&#34;&gt;kolsch&lt;/a&gt; when it kicked. Seeing how it&amp;rsquo;s still officially spring for a few more weeks, bring on &amp;ldquo;Spring Kolsch&amp;rdquo; round two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this batch I&amp;rsquo;m going to try a some of the changes I wanted to experiment with last time: Lower alcohol, and a hop bill of 100% Hallertau Mittelfrüh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This recipe is pushing the limits of what the BJCP would consider a kolsch. Compared to the traditional styles guides, this beer is a bit too light on alcohol, and a bit too heavy with the hops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not planning to send this to any competitions though. I just want to brew the ideal interpretation of koslch for my tastes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rustic Saison</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/rustic-saison/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/rustic-saison/pellicle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;pellicle in secondary&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite styles these days is mixed fermentation tart saison. Earlier in the year I made my &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/saison-vinifera&#34;&gt;first attempt&lt;/a&gt; at brewing one myself. For that beer, I blended about 20% kettle soured berliner weisse to a saison that had brett, but no souring bacteria added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;rsquo;t finished yet, but from some gravity samples I think it&amp;rsquo;s going to end up being tasty, but not as tart as I expected from my blending tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my second go at the style, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use a full range of brett and souring bacteria. To hopefully get a light tartness instead of full-on souring, I&amp;rsquo;m going to mash low and wait until a few days into fermetation before adding the sour bugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Experimenting With Hop Blends</title>

&lt;p&gt;This is batch number two of my IPA experiment series. In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/galaxy-citra-neipa-experiment&#34;&gt;first batch&lt;/a&gt; I tested out some new equipment and techniques. The beers were some of the best IPAs I&amp;rsquo;ve ever made, but they were very hard to tell apart. It felt like I had one beer taking up two taps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe a bad sign for my motivation for testing small tweaks, but for this round I feel like having a litte fun and brewing two significantly different IPAs just to compare the hop blends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have ideas of what hops I like, but it&amp;rsquo;ll be nice to have two equally fresh beers to taste at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dark Saison I</title>

      <guid>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/dark-saison-i/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This batch continues the deep dive I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking into mixed fermentation brewing over the last 6 months. I have a bunch of sours in the pipeline now and I&amp;rsquo;d like to get some funky, non-sour, brett beers going. I brewed my first &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/saison-vinifera&#34;&gt;brett saison&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago. This will be my second attempt in the broad style of funky saison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2019/04/dark-funky-saison-retrospective.html&#34;&gt;10 year retrospective&lt;/a&gt; from The Mad Fermentationist&amp;rsquo;s yearly dark saison project was inspirational. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to keep up my own similar series. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll probably take inspiration from Mike and friends the first couple years, and then strike out with my own experimental brews as I get more comfortable with this style of funky brewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the standout beers from that tasting was year four&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2012/01/american-farmhouse-currant-dark-saison.html&#34;&gt;American Farmhouse Currant Dark Saison&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to brew that recipe for the first shot at this style.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Saison Vinifera</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/saison-vinifera/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitis_vinifera&#34;&gt;Vitus Vinifera&lt;/a&gt; is the scientific name for the species that contains most varieties of wine grapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;Saison Vinifera&amp;rdquo; will blend funky tart saison, oak, and wine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/sapwood-saisons-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bottles of No Beginnings and First Blush&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large portion of my homebrewing over the last six months has been focused on trying to emulate the great mixed fermentation beers coming out of my favorite local brewery, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sapwoodcellars.com&#34;&gt;Sapwood Cellars&lt;/a&gt;. Two of those beers were delicious tart saisons that they released in fall 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Beginnings&lt;/strong&gt; was a pale saison with Brettanomyces, aged in Sauvignon Blanc wine barrels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d be willing to bet that &lt;strong&gt;First Blush&lt;/strong&gt; started life as a similar base beer to No Beginnings, but it was fermented with chardonnay &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomace&#34;&gt;pomace&lt;/a&gt;, and finished on whole Cabernet Franc grapes. It is rosé in appearance and the flavor has a unique light, tart fruitiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plan is to brew a batch of funky pale saison, split it half in secondary, and see how close to each of these I can get&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been homebrewing for nearly 10 years, but in that time I&amp;rsquo;ve only made one German beer, my recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/extract-kettle-sour-berliner-weisse&#34;&gt;Berliner Weisse&lt;/a&gt;. This neglect of the German styles needs to be rectified!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love kolsch, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been happy to see it gaining a small but significant popularity in the US in the last decade. I think the only reason I haven&amp;rsquo;t made one is just that I&amp;rsquo;ve been distracted making lots of English bitters/milds and Belgain wits to satisfy my low bitterness session beer needs. The time for Kolsch has arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When making a new style for the first time, I like to go with a trusted recipe. This beer is very close to The Mad Fermentationist&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themadfermentationist.com/2010/09/fall-kolsch-recipe.html&#34;&gt;Fall Kolsch&lt;/a&gt;. His example is on the bitter end for this style, but I think that will be to my liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it&amp;rsquo;s the end of March, not early September, I&amp;rsquo;ll call my version &amp;ldquo;Spring Kolsch&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;One of my brewing goals for 2020 is to improve the quality of my IPAs. I feel like this far into the brewing game, I should have a little more to show for it when I make my favorite style. They&amp;rsquo;re rarely bad, but they don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt; as often as I&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To that end I&amp;rsquo;m going to be doing a series of experiments this year where make two similar beers at the same time, with just one variable changed. I hope this will improve my process, one tweak at at time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this brew, I&amp;rsquo;m trying out some new hardware and techniques that I&amp;rsquo;ll use for the rest of my upcoming experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pale Apricot Sour</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sour time again! This type of beer has a long turnaround time, so I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get a lage pipeline going this winter. Hopefully next year I can start having somewhat regular releases of finished sours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This batch is inspired by Sapwood Cellars &lt;a href=&#34;https://untappd.com/b/sapwood-cellars-brewery-upper-bound-apricot/3636986&#34;&gt;Upper Bound: Apricot&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first first apricot sour I ever tried, and I thought it was fantastic. One of my favorite releases from them so far.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Solera Series: Year One Recipe &#43; Notes</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/solera-series-year-one-recipe-notes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the recipe for my Flanders Red solera project as brewed in late 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a slightly Americanized take on the style, based on the &amp;ldquo;Wine Barrel Flemish Red&amp;rdquo; from American Sour Beers. I may change it a bit over the years as I see how the beer develops. I&amp;rsquo;ll link to any new posts related to this recipe in the notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Double sour brew day!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still very new to sour beer brewing. Rather than going off and experimenting right away, I want to start with some proven recipes. Today I&amp;rsquo;m starting a couple of beers inspired by my favorite sours to come out of Sapwood Cellars to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, &lt;a href=&#34;https://untappd.com/b/sapwood-cellars-brewery-opulence/3497213&#34;&gt;Opulence&lt;/a&gt;, a sour red that has two separate cherry additions.  Aged in a mix of red wine and bourbon barrels, dry sour cherries were added early in the aging process, and then before bottling it was finished on fresh sour cherries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before trying it I was a little skeptical of combination of bourbon bourbon aging a sour beer, but the vanilla character of the barrels worked really nicely with the cherries.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rye Barrel Old Ale</title>
      <link>https://wallflowerbrewing.com/rye-barrel-old-ale/</link>

&lt;p&gt;The second beer to go into my 15 gallon Dad&amp;rsquo;s Hat rye whiskey barrel will be an old ale brewed with black treacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Old ale is a wide ranging style. For this version we&amp;rsquo;re shooting for ~7% abv (before barrel aging), complexity from black treacle, and not too much residual sugar. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this all plays nicely with the gentle contribution from a barrel that&amp;rsquo;s already held imperial stout for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for the recipe comes from a Beer and Brewing &lt;a href=&#34;https://beerandbrewing.com/make-your-best-old-ale/&#34;&gt;article on old ale&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Extract Kettle Sour Berliner Weisse</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/starter-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lacto starter&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/souring-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Souring&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked Berliner Weisse, but never brewed one. And I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting to experiment with kettle souring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The procedure I&amp;rsquo;m following comes from this great presentation by Derek Springer: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fivebladesbrewing.com/presentations/berliner-and-beyond-sour-mashing-and-its-applications/&#34;&gt;Berliner and Beyond: Sour Mashing and Its Applications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a starter for your lacto&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your wort under 4.5 pH as soon as possible to deter unwanted microbes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold at a happy temperature for your lacto strain&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimize oxygen exposure by covering with plastic wrap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, boil, chill, and pitch yeast as normal to finish the beer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Rye Barrel Stout</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://wallflowerbrewing.com/img/rye-stout/boil.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;We&amp;rsquo;re going to need a bigger fermenter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beer is the first brew to go into my 15 gallon Dad&amp;rsquo;s Hat rye whiskey barrel. That barrel is destined for sour solera duty, but first I want to brew a couple of big clean beers to make the most of the barrel&amp;rsquo;s fresh whiskey character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This stout is based on a KBS clone recipe from Zymurgy that I first brewed way back in 2013. That was a great beer, and I&amp;rsquo;m excited to try making it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
